# Ball Launcher
A mini game where you have to destroy a tower using balls. This game is adapted to mobiles and supports the use of the TouchScreen as well as MultiTouch (use of several fingers).


I made this game during the Udemy course called "[Unity C# Mobile Game Development - Make 3 Games From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-mobile/)".

## Motivation
I wanted to review my basics, adapt my knowledge of game programming to mobile game programming so that I could then create my own games later.
